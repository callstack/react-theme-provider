## About

`@callstack/react-theme-provider` is a set of utilities that help you create your own theming system in few easy steps.
You can use it to customize colors, fonts, etc.

## Features

- Works in **React** and **React Native**
- `createTheming(defaultTheme)` - factory returns:
  - `ThemeProvider` - component
  - `withTheme` - Higher Order Component
  - `useTheme` - React Hook

## Examples

- built-in example for web react - ['/examples/web'](/examples/web)
- [![Edit v6o562k6l7](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/v6o562k6l7)

## Getting started

### Installation

```sh
npm install --save @callstack/react-theme-provider
```

or using yarn

```sh
yarn add @callstack/react-theme-provider
```

### Usage

Import `createTheming` from the library to create a theming object.

```js
import { createTheming } from '@callstack/react-theme-provider';

const { ThemeProvider, withTheme, useTheme } = createTheming(defaultTheme);
```

Then wrap your code in `ThemeProvider` component to make it available to all components.

```js
<ThemeProvider>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

You can access the theme data in your components by wrapping it in `withTheme` HOC:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div style={{ color: props.theme.primaryColor }}>Hello</div>;
  }
}

export default withTheme(App);
```

You can also use the [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) based API:

```js
function App() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return <div style={{ color: theme.primaryColor }}>Hello</div>;
}
```

### Usage

```js
const App = ({ theme }) => (
  <div style={{ color: theme.primaryColor }}>
    Hello
  </div>
);

export withTheme(App);
```

### Injected props

It will inject the following props to the component:

- `theme` - our theme object.
- `getWrappedInstance` - exposed by some HOCs like react-redux's `connect`.
  Use it to get the ref of the underlying element.

### Injecting theme by a direct prop

You can also override `theme` provided by `ThemeProvider` by setting `theme` prop on the component wrapped in `withTheme` HOC.

Just like this:

```js
const Button = withTheme(({ theme }) => (
  <div style={{ color: theme.primaryColor }}>Click me</div>
));

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={{ primaryColor: 'red' }}>
    <Button theme={{ primaryColor: 'green' }} />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

In this example Button will have green text.

## `createTheming`

**type:**

```js
<T, S>(defaultTheme: T) => {
  ThemeProvider: ThemeProviderType<T>,
  withTheme: WithThemeType<T, S>,
}
```

This is more advanced replacement to classic importing `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme` directly from the library.
Thanks to it you can create your own ThemeProvider with any default theme.

Returns instance of `ThemeProvider` component and `withTheme` HOC.
You can use this factory to create a singleton with your instances of `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme`.

> **Note:** `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme` generated by `createTheming` always will use different context so make sure you are using matching `withTheme`!
> If you acidentially import `withTheme` from `@callstack/react-theme-provider` instead of your theming instance it won't work.

### Arguments

- `defaultTheme` - default theme object

### Benefits

- Possibility to define `flow` types for your theme
- Possibility to pass default theme
- You can use multiple `ThemeProvider`s in your app without any conflicts.

### Usage

```js
// theming.js
import { createTheming } from '@callstack/react-theme-provider';
const { ThemeProvider, withTheme } = createTheming({
  primaryColor: 'red',
  secondaryColor: 'green',
});
export { ThemeProvider, withTheme };

//App.js
import { ThemeProvider, withTheme } from './theming';
```

### Helpers

#### `ThemeProvider`

**type:**

```js
type ThemeProviderType<Theme> = React.ComponentType<{
  children: React.Node,
  theme?: Theme,
}>;
```

Component you have to use to provide the theme to any component wrapped in `withTheme` HOC.

##### Props

-`theme` - your theme object

#### `withTheme`

**type:**

```js
type WithThemeType<Theme> = React.ComponentType<{ theme: Theme }>
```

Higher Order Component which takes your component as an argument and injects `theme` prop into it.

## Applying a custom theme to a component

If you want to change the theme for a certain component, you can directly pass the theme prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the Provider.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import MyButton from './MyButton';

export default function ButtonExample() {
  return <MyButton theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>Press me</MyButton>;
}
```

#### `useTheme`

**type:**

```js
type UseTheme = (overrides?: PartialTheme) => Theme;
```

Hook which takes theme overrides and returns a theme object.

Example:

```js
function App(props) {
  const theme = useTheme(props.theme);

  return <div style={{ color: theme.primaryColor }}>Hello</div>;
}
```

## Applying a custom theme to a component

If you want to change the theme for a certain component, you can directly pass the theme prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the Provider.

import MyButton from './MyButton';

export default function ButtonExample() {
  return <MyButton theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>Press me</MyButton>;
}
```

## Gotchas

The `ThemeProvider` exposes the theme to the components via [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html),
which means that the component must be in the same tree as the `ThemeProvider`. Some React Native components will render a
different tree such as a `Modal`, in which case the components inside the `Modal` won't be able to access the theme. The work
around is to get the theme using the `withTheme` HOC and pass it down to the components as props, or expose it again with the
exported `ThemeProvider` component.
