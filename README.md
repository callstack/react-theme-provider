## About 
`@callstack/react-theme-provider` is a set of utilities that help you create your own theming system in few easy steps.
You can use it to customize colors, fonts, etc.

## Features
 - works in **React** and **React Native**
 - `ThemeProvider` - component
 - `withTheme` - Higher Order Component
 - `createTheming(defaultTheme)` - factory returns `ThemeProvider` component and `withTheme` HOC with default theme injected.

## Getting started
### Instalation
```
npm install --save @callstack/react-theme-provider
```
or using yarn
```
yarn add @callstack/react-theme-provider
```

### Usage
To use, simply wrap your code into `ThemeProvider` component and pass your theme as a `theme` prop.

```js
<ThemeProvider theme={{ primaryColor: 'red', background: 'gray'}}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

You could access theme data inside every component by wraping it into `withTheme` HOC. Just like this:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ color: props.theme.primaryColor }}>
        Hello
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default withTheme(App);
```

## `ThemeProvider`
**type:** `React.ComponentType<{ children?: any, theme?: T }>`

Component you have to use to provide the theme to any component wrapped in `withTheme` HOC.

### props
 -`theme` - your theme object

## `withTheme`
**type:** `(React.ComponentType<*>) => React.ComponentType<*>`

Classic Higher Order Component which takes your component as an argument and inject `theme` prop into it.

### Example of usage
```js
const App = ({ theme }) => (
  <div style={{ color: theme.primaryColor }}>
    Hello
  </div>
);

export withTheme(App);
```

### Injected props
It will inject the following props to the component:
 - `theme` - our theme object.
 - `getWrappedInstance` -  exposed by some HOCs like react-redux's `connect`.
 Use it to get the ref of the underlying element.
 - `setNativeProps` - used by `Animated` (in React Native) to set props on the native component.

### Injecting theme by a direct prop
You can also override `theme` provided by `ThemeProvider` by setting `theme` prop on the component wrapped in `withTheme` HOC.

Just like this:
```js
const Button = withTheme(({ theme }) => (
  <div style={{ color: theme.primaryColor }}>
    Click me
  </div>
));

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={{ primaryColor: 'red' }}>
    <Button theme= {{ primaryColor: 'green' }}/>
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```
In this example Button will have green text.

## `createTheming`
**type:** `<T>(defaultTheme: T) => ThemingType<T>`

This is more advanced replacement to classic importing `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme` directly from the library.
Thanks to it you can create your own ThemeProvider with any default theme.

Returns instance of `ThemeProvider` component and `withTheme` HOC. 
You can use this factory to create a singleton with your instances of `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme`.

>**Note:** `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme` generated by `createTheming` always will have unique context key so make sure you are using matching `withTheme`! If you acidentially import `withTheme` from `@callstack/react-theme-provider` instead of your theming instance it won't work.

### Arguments
 - `defaultTheme` - default theme object

### Benefits
 - Possibility to define flow types for your theme
 - Possibility to pass default theme
 - Unique context key for each instance so you can use multiple `ThemeProvider`s in your app without any conflicts.

### Example of usage
```js
// theming.js
import { createTheming } from '@callstack/react-theme-provider';
const { ThemeProvider, withTheme } = createTheming({
  primaryColor: 'red',
  secondaryColor: 'green',
});
export { ThemeProvider, withTheme };

//App.js
import { ThemeProvider, withTheme } from './theming';
```

## Applying a custom theme to a component
If you want to change the theme for a certain component, you can directly pass the theme prop to the component. The theme passed as the prop is merged with the theme from the Provider.

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import MyButton from './MyButton';

export default function ButtonExample() {
  return (
    <MyButton theme={{ roundness: 3 }}>
      Press me
    </MyButton>
  );
}
```

## Gotchas
The `ThemeProvider` exposes the theme to the components via [React's context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), 
which means that the component must be in the same tree as the `ThemeProvider`. Some React Native components will render a 
different tree such as a `Modal`, in which case the components inside the `Modal` won't be able to access the theme. The work 
around is to get the theme using the `withTheme` HOC and pass it down to the components as props, or expose it again with the 
exported `ThemeProvider` component.
